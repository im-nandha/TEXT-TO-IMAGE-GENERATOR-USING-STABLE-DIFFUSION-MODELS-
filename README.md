# TEXT-TO-IMAGE-GENERATOR-USING-STABLE-DIFFUSION-MODELS-
Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image latent diffusion model created by the researchers and engineers from [CompVis](https://github.com/CompVis), [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/) and [LAION](https://laion.ai/). It's trained on 512x512 images from a subset of the [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) database. This model uses a frozen CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder to condition the model on text prompts. With its 860M UNet and 123M text encoder, the model is relatively lightweight and can run on many consumer GPUs.
See the [model card](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion) for more information.

This Colab notebook shows how to use Stable Diffusion with the ðŸ¤— Hugging Face [ðŸ§¨ Diffusers library](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers).
